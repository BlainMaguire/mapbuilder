2D tile based map editor I wrote in Javascript which can output text for a game I made.

Why it's done the way it is:

* At the time I wanted to learn more about how the DOM works, that's why I'm building elements dynamically in JS rather than just writing/generating static HTML elements.

* I set myself a number of challenges during this, rather than just using events to see what was clicked I wanted to find out how to resolve mouse to co-ords to a dyanmic grid.

* At the time I started, canvas still wasn't widely supported. If I had to do it again today I'd probably use a HTML5 based library.
